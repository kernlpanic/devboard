# Devboard 

## Description

Just a small devboard with ethernet and rs232 interface.
Almost(tm) fully THD Design with two exceptions. One is the ethernet controller and the other one is the sram module.
The main microcontroller is an Atmega32.
The full BOM I used to build this board will soon be added here

## Disclaimer

This pcb design is still work in progress and not fully testet. 
Still feel free to use it and to contact me if you like to give some advice for improvement
